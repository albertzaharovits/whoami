###Objective
Be part of an ambitious and diverse team of software developers.  
If you're planning something big, I'd love to help!

###Summary
* Skills: GNU/Linux, C/C++, Bash, Python, CUDA, Android
* Tools: Vim, Git, Mercurial, Mutt
* Interests: System Engineering, Software Security

I am a quick learner, good at finding effective solutions to problems. I am considered reasonable and practical.  
I usually challenge myself to think "outside the box".  
As a member of a team I am cooperative and reliable. I am confident and not afraid to state my opinion.

###Work

**Linux Software Engineer, [Bitdefender]** | *Aug 2014 - Present, Bucharest, RO*

Develop and deploy a framework (Python) controlling VMs running files from network tapping:

 * reworked project's architecture similar to Postfix (multiple programs and queues).
 * researched alternative network tapping technologies ([Bro])
 * integrated Redis for metadata cache ([Open Source contribution](https://github.com/bro/bro-plugins/pull/3)).

---

**Teaching Assistant, [University Politehnica of Bucharest]** | *Feb 2015 - June 2015, Bucharest, RO*

Held lab classes and evaluated projects for the [Computer System Architecture] class.  
**Topics covered**: parallel programming synchronisation, efficient C code, *Cell BE* and *CUDA* programming models with hands-on tasks.


**Undergraduate Research Assistant, [INCAS]** | *Mar 2013 - Mar 2014, Bucharest, RO*

Profiling and refactoring of a scientific topology optimisation code (Fortran).
Research fields:

  * achieved C/Fortran interoperability.
  * practiced optimisation techniques CUDA/OpenMP.
  * run batched tests on cluster.
  * used Open Source linear algebra libraries, such as [ViennaCL](Open Source contributions [here1](https://github.com/viennacl/viennacl-dev/pull/37) and [here2](https://github.com/viennacl/viennacl-dev/pull/41))



**Junior C# .NET Developer, [Visionware]** | *Jul 2012 - Mar 2013, Bucharest, RO*

Microsoft Sharepoint Site Customisation (.NET C# Framework)  
University Phone Poll Application Customization (.NET C# Framework)

###Projects
**eHonk** | *Mar - May 2014*

[Innovation Labs 2.0]  pitch finalist eHonk *Android* app
Messaging app for drivers in crowded parking lots.
Simple idea: replace "Be Right Back" leaflets in your windshield! Register your license plate number in the app so others can ping you if your vehicle is blocking them.

The project took part in the hackaton and evolved during the incubator.  
Finally we pitched and demoed, in front of tech savvy possible investors.

Learned basics of product development and Android development (Notification & Location APIs).

Teammates: Madalina Toia, Alexandru Sirbu

**RST Template Matching** | *2013*

As a participant to the [Intel Accelerate Your Code] competition,  I have implemented the [*Ciratefi* template matching algorithm] and participated in the code optimisation competition ([Project link](https://github.com/albertzaharovits/template_matching)).
The code was benchmarked on latest Intel Xeon and Xeon PHI processors.
Skills: Intel compilers suite; OpenMP parallelized; Cilk vectorization.

Prize: **5th place (Europe)**

###Volunteer

**Assistant Trainer** | *Sep 2015*
Assisted teaching lab sessions of the [StreamComputing] workshop on OpenCL held at [University Politehnica of Bucharest].

###School
